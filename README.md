This is a simple React.js application which tracks a list of expenses entered by the user. This project is still in progress. I am currently implementing an Express.js backend following the MERN stack.

## Improvements and New Features

- MongoDB implementation
- Ability to create recurring transactions and their dates of collection
- Graph to show spending
